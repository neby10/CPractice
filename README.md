Purpose: To practice my C programming abilities.

Challenges for Programming in C
1. FizzBuzz: Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three, print "fizz" instead of the number. 
For multiples of five, print "buzz" instead of the number. For numbers that are multiiples of both three and five, print "fizzbuzz".
2. Sum of Array: Write a program that takes an array of integers and calculates the sum of all the elements.
3. Reverse String: Write a program that takes a string as input and prints it in reverse order.
4. Palindrome: Write a program that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome or not (i.e., whether it reads the same forwards and backwards).
5. Prime Numbers: Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
6. Sorting: Write a program that sorts an array of integers in ascending or descending order.
7. Fibonacci Sequence: Write a program that prints the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
8. Rock Paper Scissors: Write a program that lets the user play a game of rock-paper-scissors against the computer.
9. Caesar Cipher: Write a program that encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar cipher.
10. Binary Search: Write a program that performs a binary search on a sorted array of integers to find a specific value.


Final Project
Project Title: Library Management System
Description: Create a program that manages a library's collection of books. The program should allow librarians to add new books to the collection, 
search for books by title or author, check out books to library patrons, and keep track of due dates and late fees.
Features:
* A user-friendly interface for librarians and patrons to interact with the system.
* A database of books and their information (e.g. title, author, ISBN, publication date, etc.).
* A search function to allow patrons to find books by title or author.
* A checkout function to allow librarians to check out books to patrons, and to track due dates and late fees.
* An automatic system to send email reminders to patrons whose books are overdue.
* A function to allow librarians to add new books, delete old books, update book info (categories or genres) and view book info (CRUD) to the library's collection.
* A feature to track the library's inventory, including the number of copies of each book available.
* Adding and deleting members
* Keeping track of member borrowing history
* Updating book availability
* The system can also generate reports on various aspects of the library => Number of books borrowed by a member, Number of books in each category, Number of books borrowed and returned, Overdue books

Programming skills: data structures, algorithms, file handling, database handling, memory management, and user interface design. 
Experience in creating a practical, real-world application that can be useful for a variety of different organizations.

To build this project, you can use C programming language along with a database management system like SQLite. 
You can also use a GUI library like GTK or ncurses to create a user-friendly interface for library staff to interact with the system.
